# Challenges

Since this was my first ever game creating experience, I found it hard
to get going. I had code block (writer's block) for two days, I had to
think and re-think; I decided I'm not going to give up and kept on persisting,
which paid off eventually.This whole experience was a tremendous learning curve
for me as I learned, that in order to create big objects one must break it down
into small pieces. For example I had to create a board, so for me to do that I
had to create a 'ul' and 'li' items inside it, for which I used 'for loop'.
Time management was also a big challenge, I had 5 days to complete this
project. My main goal was to focus on game logic, I now have newfound respect
for game developers. Days were divided,first three days were focusing on
game logic; the next two days were testing and styling. Overall the whole
experience was immensely rewarding.

# Improvements

I'd like to create user objects that store user score and progression,this
I feel would personalize the game. I'd like to add animation so when the user
completes a level, it triggers an animation. It would be great If I could add
levels depending on the score, perhaps I could create a Blind Mode where the
bombs are not shown at all.
